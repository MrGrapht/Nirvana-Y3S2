# Nirvana-Y3S2

Main source of information regarding the files in this repository - https://ackay3s2.wordpress.com

If you are reading this, I'm assuming you have come across my project via my Website, Instagram or (mainly) Wordpress.
In which case, you would have most of the information/files pertaining this project.

If this is not the case, then welcome! Nirvana is an interactive AR/VR interactive experience created by yours truly to form 
my Final Major Year 3 University Project.

To find out more, please visit the link on line 3 of this document.

In this repository, you will find 3 Folders containing scripts related to my project as well as a zip folder, 'Nirvana_Scripts",
containing all the folders and files responsible for making project work (in it's current state).

NOTE:
Nirvana-Y3S2/Nirvana_Scripts/Arduino Scripts/BT_SoundSensor/BT_SoundSensor.ino - This file was part of a failed experiment 
and is not actually required to make the project work. I included it for the purpose of possible development on it (I wanted 
to have 3 sensors set up but I could only manage 2 for my deadline, more info at the link on line 3).
